# Time Series Exploration

Hi, I am Aaron, a Social Science Graduate and a Junior Data Analyst from Hong Kong, with a strong passion and curiosity on the research of an array of sophisticated human behaviours, from political decisions to financial markets and sales behaviours.

This repository mainly focuses on time-series analysis and exploration of different methodologies, including 3 major categories autoregression (ARMA, ARIMA), simulation (Monte Carlo, Markov Chains, Random Walks) and deep learning (TensorFlow, neural networks, and LSTM).

I am currently working on LSTM model to predict the next stock close. Other models are still under development and will be released later.
