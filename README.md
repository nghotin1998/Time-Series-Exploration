# Time Series Exploration

Hi, I am Aaron, a Social Science Graudate and a Junior Data Analyst from Hong Kong with strong passion and curiosity on research of an array of sophisticated human behaviours, from political decision to financial markets and salews behaviours. 

This repository mainly focueses on time-series analysis and exploration of different methodologies, including 3 major categories autoregression (ARMA, ARIMA), simulation (Monte Carlo, Markov Chains, Random Walks) and deep learning (neural networks and LSTM).
